# Data Guardian üõ°Ô∏è

**Your personal, vigilant backup assistant for Linux desktops.**

Data Guardian is a powerful Python-based backup solution designed to keep your important files, settings, and applications safe with minimal effort. It combines an intelligent daemon, a modern GTK4-based GUI, and advanced backup strategies to deliver a seamless, reliable data protection experience.

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **Automatic & Incremental Backups**
  - Persistent daemon monitors your home directory and external drives, backing up data automatically on your schedule.
  - Initial full backup stored in `.main_backup`.
  - Subsequent changes saved as incremental backups in date- and time-stamped folders, optimizing storage and recovery.

- **Smart & Selective Backup**
  - Configurable exclusions for directories, file types, and hidden files.
  - Uses metadata caching per folder (`.backup_meta.json`) to detect changes efficiently and minimize scanning overhead.
  - Skips unchanged folders automatically to speed up backups.

- **External Drive Integration**
  - Detects and backs up to your selected external storage device.
  - Checks for sufficient disk space before every copy operation.

- **Robust Backup Integrity**
  - Uses SHA-256 file hashing and file size/modification time checks to accurately identify updated files.
  - Handles backup interruptions gracefully and resumes without data loss.
  - Concurrent file copying with `ProcessPoolExecutor` for high throughput.
  - Non-blocking async design ensures smooth system performance.

- **Comprehensive Application Backup**
  - Saves a list of installed Flatpak applications regularly.
  - *(Work in Progress)* Plans to backup `.deb` and `.rpm` packages for full environment restoration.

- **Modern, User-Friendly GUI**
  - Built with GTK4 and Adwaita for a polished, native Linux experience.
  - Browse and restore individual files from `.main_backup` and incremental snapshots.
  - System Restore feature to recover applications, Flatpaks, and home directory data post-OS reinstall.
  - File preview support for common formats, including PDF and text.
  - Manage backup settings: device selection, auto-backup toggle, ignored folders, and more.

- **Resilient & Configurable Daemon**
  - Signal handling for pause, resume, and graceful shutdown.
  - Responsive to device connection changes.
  - Configurable concurrency and wait intervals.
  - Detailed logging to file and console.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How Data Guardian Works (Simplified)

1. **Setup via GUI**
   - Select backup drive.
   - Configure auto-backup, ignored folders, and other preferences.

2. **Daemon Operation**
   - On start, performs a full scan and backup to `.main_backup`.
   - Periodically rescans home directory using cached metadata to detect changes.
   - Copies new files to `.main_backup`.
   - Stores updated files in timestamped incremental folders for versioning.
   - Saves installed Flatpak app list for easy restoration.

3. **File Restoration**
   - GUI allows browsing backup snapshots.
   - Restore individual files or run a system-wide restore.
   - Preview files before restoring.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- **Python 3**
- **GTK4 & Libadwaita:** Native Linux desktop UI.
- **Asyncio & Concurrent Futures:** Efficient, non-blocking operations and parallel file copying.
- **Standard Libraries:** `os`, `shutil`, `hashlib`, `json`, `logging`, `signal`, `tempfile`
- **Third-party:** `setproctitle` for process naming.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- GTK4 & Libadwaita (e.g., `gir1.2-gtk-4.0`, `libadwaita-1-0`)
- Python GObject bindings (`python3-gi`, `python3-gi-cairo`)
- `setproctitle` (install with `pip install setproctitle`)
- Optional for PDF preview: Poppler and its introspection bindings (`gir1.2-poppler-0.18`)

### Installation

Data Guardian is intended to be installed as a Flatpak for the best user experience.

**1. Via Flatpak (Recommended)**

   *(Note: Flatpak manifest and build instructions are under development. Once available, you will typically build and install it locally as follows. For official releases, it might be available on Flathub or another repository.)*

   First, ensure you have `flatpak` and `flatpak-builder` installed on your system.

   Clone the repository (if you haven't already):
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/dataguardian.git
   cd dataguardian
   ```

   Then, navigate to the directory containing the Flatpak manifest (e.g., `build-aux/` or the project root if the manifest is there) and run:
   ```bash
   flatpak-builder --force-clean --user --install builddir <your-app-id>.yaml
   # Replace <your-app-id>.yaml with the actual manifest file name, e.g., com.github.yourusername.dataguardian.yaml
   ```

**2. Manual Installation (for development or testing)**

   Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/dataguardian.git
   cd dataguardian
   ```
   Install Python dependencies (preferably in a virtual environment):
   ```bash
   # python3 -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   Ensure system dependencies listed in "Prerequisites" are met.

### Running the GUI

After manual installation (if it includes desktop integration steps), the app may appear in your system's main application menu.
