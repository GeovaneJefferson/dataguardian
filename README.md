## Core Features

### Daemon Features

The daemon, the core of Data Guardian, silently works in the background to manage your backups:

*   **Automatic Backups:** Runs at regular intervals to check for new or changed files.
*   **Intelligent File Scanning:** Uses metadata caching for quick folder checks and SHA-256 hashing for precise file change detection.
*   **Incremental Backups:** Creates a full initial backup, then saves only changes in timestamped increments, saving space.
*   **Robust File Copying:** Employs atomic file operations, preserves metadata, and adjusts copy concurrency based on system load.
*   **Interruption Handling:** Resumes interrupted backup processes intelligently.
*   **Disk Space Management:** Checks backup drive space before starting.
*   **Automatic Package Backup:** Backs up downloaded `.deb` and `.rpm` packages.
*   **Backup Drive Monitoring:** Ensures the backup drive is connected and writable.
*   **System Signal Handling:** Gracefully handles system signals (terminate, interrupt, pause, resume).
*   **Detailed Logging:** Logs all significant actions and errors.
*   **UI Communication:** Sends real-time status and progress to the GUI via a socket.
*   **Single Instance Guarantee:** Prevents multiple daemon instances from running.
*   **Configurable Exclusions:** Allows excluding specific folders, hidden files/folders, or by file extensions.

### GUI Features

The GTK4-based graphical user interface (GUI) provides an intuitive way to interact with Data Guardian:

*   **Device Selection:** Easily select your external drive for backups.
*   **Real-time Monitoring:** Displays daemon status, current scanning folder, and file transfer progress.
*   **Configuration Options:** Manage automatic backups, excluded folders/files, and other settings.
*   **File Browsing and Search:** Navigate and search within your backups.
*   **File Restoration:** Restore individual files or entire directories.
*   **Visual Overviews:** View backup summary statistics (file categories, frequent files).
*   **Suggested Files:** Recommends files for backup based on usage patterns.
*   **Starred Files:** Mark important backed-up files for quick access.
*   **System Restore:** Restore applications (.deb/.rpm), files/folders, and Flatpaks.
*   **Logging Access:** View daemon logs directly from the GUI.
*   **Diff Viewing:** Compare different backed-up versions of text files against the current version in your home directory.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

*   **Python 3**
*   **GTK4 & Libadwaita:** Native Linux desktop UI.
*   **Asyncio & `concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor`:** Efficient, non-blocking operations and parallel file copying for the daemon.
*   **Standard Libraries:** `os`, `shutil`, `hashlib`, `json`, `logging`, `signal`, `tempfile`, `socket`, `configparser`, `datetime`, `subprocess`, `psutil`, etc.
*   **Third-party:** `setproctitle` for daemon process naming.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

*   Python 3.8+
*   GTK4 & Libadwaita (e.g., `gir1.2-gtk-4.0`, `libadwaita-1-0` on Debian/Ubuntu based systems)
*   Python GObject bindings (`python3-gi`, `python3-gi-cairo`)
*   `psutil` (install with `pip install psutil`)
*   `setproctitle` (install with `pip install setproctitle`)

### 1. Running from Source (for Development)

This is the recommended method for development and local testing.

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/geovanejefferson/dataguardian.git
    cd dataguardian
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies (using a virtual environment is recommended):**
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3.  **Run the application:**
    ```bash
    python3 src/ui.py
    ```

### 2. Building and Installing with Flatpak

This method builds the application as a Flatpak package, which is the intended distribution format.

1.  **Build and install the Flatpak:**
    ```bash
    cd dataguardian
    ```
    ```bash
    flatpak-builder --user --install --force-clean build-dir io.github.geovanejefferson.dataguardian.yaml
    ```
